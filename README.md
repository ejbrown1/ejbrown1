- 👋 Hi, I’m @ejbrown1

- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino Software development type projects involving NodeMCU ESP8266, and various sensors, for projecats around the house, tec.
  I do a fair bit of cing now for work, utilizing Visual Studio(VB) .Net various versions.  I do a lot with SQL Servers, PI Servers, etc..

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to utilize the PZEM004T power metering device, so that I can monitor some feeder circuits in my house, 
  from my power panel, such as the Hot Tub, Hot water tank, Air to Air heat pump, furnace, total panel power.  
  Some intent here would be to notify me if the hot tub does not use anough heat, for example, in teh winter time, and will be subject to freezing. So send me a text that is did not use enough.
  This woudl be similar as to how I made a ESP8266 Nodemcu board monitor my garage door, and text me if it stays open longer thna 3 minutes, repeating every 5 minutes till it gets closed.  I also use Blynk App to monitor and control the garage door.  Security motion sensors. Sump Pump water detector.
